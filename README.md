## Next Steps

If there had been more time, the following features could have been added to enhance the application:

1. **Search Functionality**  
   Implement a search to look for specific shows

2. **Local Storage Toggle**  
   The local storage util could be simplified to "toggle", making it easier to add to the list of faves

3. **Dark Mode Toggle**  
   Toggle to switch between light and dark themes

4. **Improved UI**  
   I could spend days just working on the UI!

5. **Multi Language**  
   Might have limitations in terms of the API, but it would be interesting to have multiple languages

6. **More extensive tests**  
   The test suite could be expanded to properly test the custom hooks, edge cases and individual components

7. **API Pagination**  
   The TV Maze API limits the list of shows to 250, so I'd put in extra work to ensure the API consumption
